         <p id="bp"> The Turkish currency crisis is one example of a modern-day economic crisis. In late 2018, the value of the Turkish lira as expressed in commodities plummeted, driving up inflation to 25 percentage points. The currency crisis was caused by a crisis of capital, involving financial speculation and overproduction. Many Turkish companies invested heavily in an over-saturated (and seemingly booming) construction market, which the firms attempted to exploit. These corporations are now unable to pay back their loans in lira, perhaps leading to a capital supply shock. As overproduction (and not undercomsumption) is a fact of capitalist crisis, this inflation is inextricable from the nature of the capitalist mode of production itself (for more on this, see Kozo Unoâ€™s Theories of Capitalist Crisis). <br>
         The summer of 2019 has still seen immense inflation rates, with a PPP increase of 16.65% in July, decreasing to 15% in September. It seems that the Turkish government projects inflation to radically drop in the near future, as they have decreased benchmark interest rates by 4.25% (from 24%-19.5%!). Therefore the Turkish Government has most likely taken all the requisite steps to curb inflation. At the same time, the extraordinary price increases forecast labor unrest across the country. If prices go up, wages effectively go down. One can count on the working class to struggle to maintain its wages, which will destabilize the Erdogan still reeling from its electoral defeat in Istanbul. </p>
