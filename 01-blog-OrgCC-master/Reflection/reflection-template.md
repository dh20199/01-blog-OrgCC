# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)
    A core issue of the practice of history is an issue of democracy: history of whom? by whom? and for what other purpose? These questions carry a moral and political sense: what historians write, as a way of knowing, have an impact on the population at large-- I would add that this knowledge can be used for repression, concealment, and barbarism or towards the purpose of liberation. Because of the general elitist nature of historical research, which is not necessarily the fault of historians, the more accessible and more public data is the more likely it can be wielded as a tool or weapon against attacks on the public. Therefore clarity is essential, especially in the digital age, for as people like Paul Virillio have noticed, excesses of information &#40;the information bomb&#41; can be as effective as weapons of mass destruction. Therefore the more searchable information is and the more possible people that can access it is the better for working people. To both of those ends do semantic elements progress. 

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.
